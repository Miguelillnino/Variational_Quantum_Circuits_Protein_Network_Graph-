## Introduction to the protein-protein interactions
* Protein are made of amino acids chain, which are biomolecules that  have several biochemical interaction between them. 
* 3D-protein structure depends on the the biochemical bondings between the structure to reach their functional form.
* Detect and found the portion of the chemical interaction that stabilize the molecule have several application as farmacology, biology and bioinformatics.
